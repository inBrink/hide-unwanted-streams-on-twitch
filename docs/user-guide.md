# How to use
## Overlay menu
After installation there will be a menu added on [twitch.tv](http://www.twitch.tv/) for using and configuring "Hide unwanted streams on Twitch" solution. The menu can be accessed by hovering mouse over a stream, video or game thumbnail on supported pages (see [Supported pages](#supported-pages) section further in this document), like on the following screenshot:

## Blocking a channel
To block a channel open [Channels](http://www.twitch.tv/directory/all) page or any game page, for example [Dark Souls](http://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Dark%20Souls) page and use `Block` button in the [overlay menu](#overlay-menu) on a stream thumbnail. The channel will be added to the "Blocked Channels" list and content of that channel will not be visible anymore unless unblocked back.

## Blocking a game
To block a game open [Games](http://www.twitch.tv/directory) page and use `Block` button in the [overlay menu](#overlay-menu) on a game thumbnail. The game will be added to the "Blocked Games" list and content of that game will not be visible anymore unless unblocked back. See picture below:

## Unblocking content
To unblock content that has been blocked use the [overlay menu](#overlay-menu) and click `Settings` button to access Setting window. Open "Blocked Channels" and "Blocked Games" tabs to find blocked items and click `Unblock` button to unblock them, like on the following picture:
